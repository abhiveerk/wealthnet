Load individual index data from google drive (ie Banknifty), whose return features have already been calculated (12 features; 4 cross-sectional indices' lagged returns are used as features; t-1, t-5, t-10. 3 features per index x 4 incides yields 12 features).\n","2. Split data into 3 trading sessions across the day; morning (beginning until 1030am), midday (from 1030 until 2pm) and afternoon (until the end of the day); the purpose of splitting data is to be able to normalize data and train seperate models for each trading session, since they may exhibit different patterns. Data for the first 30 minutes (which is the lookback period used while scaling) of each trading session for each day has been dropped, since these data points would be using the previous day's returns during scaling, which doesn't make much sense.\n","3. Normalize data, using z-score normalization, and downsize dataset to only those data points that are above 1 standard deviation from the mean; the purpose of this is to get rid of noisy data during testing. Check correlation matrix for descaled data.\n","4. Once data has been downsized, descale it back to original values and use this in training the LSTM (as suggested by Puneet on 1st July).\n","5. Split data into train/test sets and run LSTM model, plot predicted values against test data to verify.\n","\n","Questions and Next Steps 04th July:\n","- Correlation matrix for each trading session shows practically no correlation between lagged returns and t+5 predicted returns? Is it worth exploring this model any further or can switch to predicting direction of returns using these same features.\n","- If moving further with this, will have to ask Puneet whether to add additional features, how best to tune the model's hyperparameters, or which other models to try (SVM, random forest, or other).\n","- Also wanted to ask, how best to verify the accuracy of this sort of predictive model; should I add labels to data points that are close enough to the actual returns at a certain margin and check how many of these points were accurately predicted?"],"metadata":{"id":"sqegx5vx5zEY"}},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":null,"metadata":{"colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/"},"id":"VcwnYfHIXJ2i","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1720163468060,"user_tz":-330,"elapsed":5820,"user":{"displayName":"Abhiveer
